*seamcarvego* is an implementation of a [seam
carving](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seam_carving) algorithm. To begin, I am
just porting as assignment I did for an algorithms class to Golang, in a test
driven manner, but I plan on implementing optimizations on top of that, once the
implementation is stable and has good test coverage.

A frontend will be coming once the implementation is completed.
