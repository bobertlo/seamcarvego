# seamcarvego

*seamcarvego* is an implementation of
[seam carving](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seam_carving). To begin I am
just porting my homework from an algorithms class to Golang, in a test driven
manner, but I plan on then testing other more optimized implementations.

A frontend will be coming once the implementation is completed.
